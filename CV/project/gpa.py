    1. Translate each example so that its centre of gravity is at the origin.
    2. Choose one example as an initial estimate of the mean shape and scale so that |x| = sqrt(x1^2+x2^2..)=1 
    3. Record the first estimate as x0 to define the default orientation.
    4. Align all the shapes with the current estimate of the mean shape. 
    5. Re-estimate the mean from aligned shapes.
    6. Apply constraints on scale and orientation to the current estimate of the mean by aligning it with Â¯
       x0 and scaling so that |x| = 1.
    7. If not converged, return to 4.
       (Convergence is declared if the estimate of the mean does not change significantly after an iteration)
